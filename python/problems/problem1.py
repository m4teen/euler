Problem: 

1. Maths theory: dealing with natural numbers and multiples, thus there may be division involved

2. Examples of theory: find lcm, find gcd, find coprime pairs, sum multiples, find modulo p numbers 

3. We are essentially dividing the numbers in the list to check if we get a 0 residue in the mod operation 
for 3 or 5, which is fine. 

Caution 1: But we want to consider numbers strictly below n (off by one error)
Caution 2: Don't want to double add numbers divisble by both 3 and 5 (inclusion-exclusion)
