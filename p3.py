"""

This was my first attempt, it was a direct representation of the mathematical problem in code. 
It generates all primes up to n using a dictionary and tests each integer 
for primality by dividing it by all previously found primes. Once the sieve is built, it 
searches for the largest prime factor of n by checking which primes divide n.

Time complexity: O(n^2 / log n), due to checking divisibility for every integer up to n
against an increasingly large list of previously found primes.

Space complexity: O(n / log n), since it stores all primes up to n.

"""

This optimised approach avoids generating a full list of primes. Instead, it performs 
trial division: starting from 2, it repeatedly divides out prime factors from n, reducing 
n until all smaller factors are removed. After 2 is handled, it only checks odd numbers, 
since all even numbers would already be factored out. After removing the even numbers, 
the function implements a greedy, compressed factor tree to quickly 
find the prime factors. 


Time complexity: O(âˆšn), since only divisors up to the square root of n are tested,
and each factor is divided out completely when located.

Space complexity: O(1), as it uses only a fixed number of integer variables.
