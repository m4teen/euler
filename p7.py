This function-th prime finds the n-th prime by checking successive odd numbers for primality using trial division 
against all previously found primes. It starts from 2 and tests each candidate up to the desired count.

Time complexity: O(nâˆšp), where p is the n-th prime (since each number is tested against all prior primes)
Space complexity: O(n), for storing the list of found primes

This algorithm uses a sieve to precompute all primes <= limit and dynamically doubles the limit 
until it finds at least n primes. It is marginally more 
efficient than the nth_prime function.
Time complexity: Amortised O(n log log N), where N is the value of the n-th prime
Space complexity: O(N), where N is the size of the current sieve array
