# Project Euler Solutions

My solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) â€“ a
collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that
require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

This repository contains my personal journey through the problems,
along with clean and self-documenting solutions in code.
